# Performance Analysis

## Overview

This document presents **performance benchmarks** for the real-time K-Means image segmentation system across different backends. Performance is measured in **frames per second (FPS)** during live webcam processing at $640 \times 480$ resolution with varying cluster counts ($K$). We also discuss **algorithmic complexity**, **RCC tree efficiency**, and insights from relevant literature.

***

## Benchmark Configuration

**Test Environment:**

* **Resolution:** $640 \times 480$ pixels (307,200 total pixels)
* **Coreset Size:** 2,000 points
* **Color Scale:** 1.0
* **Spatial Scale:** 0.5
* **Input Source:** Live webcam feed
* **Measurement Window:** 3-second rolling average for min/max FPS
* **MPI Configuration:** Tested with 4 MPI ranks, each using OpenMP threads.

**Algorithmic Complexity:**

* **Sequential K-Means:** $O(n k t)$, where $n$ = number of pixels, $k$ = clusters, $t$ = iterations
* **Coreset K-Means:** Reduced complexity to $O(s k t)$, with $s \ll n$ points in coreset
* **RCC Tree Update:** Each insertion and merge is $O(s \log N)$ for $N$ accumulated frames

**Literature Insight:**

* RCC trees have been shown to maintain $(1 \pm \epsilon)$-approximation of full K-Means with **bounded memory** and **incremental update time** [Feldman et al., 2013].
* Weighted coreset merges preserve clustering quality while supporting **streaming scenarios** efficiently.

## FPS Performance by Backend and K-value (Updated)

| Backend | K=2 (Min FPS) | K=2 (Max FPS) | K=15 (Min FPS) | K=15 (Max FPS) | Perf. Ratio |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sequential** | 15 | 17 | 5 | 6 | 1.0× (baseline) |
| **Multi-threaded** | 14 | 44 | 10 | 22 | 2.4× avg |
| **MPI Hybrid** | 17 | 44 | 13 | 21 | 2.6× avg |
| **CUDA** | 14 | 55 | 15 | 44 | 3.2× avg |

**Observations:**

* **CUDA** remains the peak performer, especially at higher $K$ values.
* The **MPI Hybrid** implementation matches the peak performance of the **Multi-threaded** backend at $K=2$ and outperforms it at $K=15$ (Min FPS).
* **Sequential** drops significantly with increasing $K$, confirming theoretical $O(n k t)$ scaling.

## K-value Performance Degradation (Updated)

| Backend | K=2 $\rightarrow$ K=15 (Max FPS) | Reduction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sequential** | 17 $\rightarrow$ 6 FPS | ~65% reduction |
| **Multi-threaded** | 44 $\rightarrow$ 22 FPS | ~50% reduction |
| **MPI Hybrid** | 44 $\rightarrow$ 21 FPS | ~52% reduction |
| **CUDA** | 55 $\rightarrow$ 44 FPS | ~20% reduction |

> **Key Insight:** The robust parallelization of the **CUDA** backend provides the best resistance to performance degradation as the cluster count $K$ increases. The **Multi-threaded** and **MPI Hybrid** backends offer comparable scalability improvements over the Sequential baseline.

## Backend-Specific Analysis
### Multi-threaded (CPU)

* **Complexity:** $O(\frac{n}{p} k t)$, where $p$ = threads
* **Good scaling** on multi-core systems, achieving $\sim 2.4\times$ average speedup over Sequential.
* **Memory-safe:** Threads operate on independent row slices, requiring minimal synchronization ($\text{join}$ only).
* **Best for:** Local multi-core systems where low latency and high core count are available.

### MPI Hybrid (Distributed)

* **Complexity:** $O(\frac{n}{p} k t + \text{comm})$
* **Strong performance** achieved by combining **process-level** (MPI) and **thread-level** (OpenMP) parallelism.
* **Performance depends** on efficient $\text{MPI\_Bcast}$ for centers and $\text{MPI\_Gatherv}$ for results, but the new implementation shows significant gains, achieving a $2.6\times$ average speedup.
* **Ideal for:** Large images or cluster environments where work can be distributed across multiple physical nodes.

### Sequential (CPU)

* **Complexity:** $O(n k t)$
* **Predictable but slow**, especially at high $K$.
* **Best for:** Deterministic results, debugging, or resource-limited single-core systems.

### CUDA (GPU)

* **Complexity:** $O(n k t / \text{GPU cores})$
* **Peak performance** for high-resolution streaming, consistently offering the highest FPS across all $K$ values.
* **Data transfer cost** (Host $\leftrightarrow$ Device) may introduce FPS variability.
* **Best for:** High-throughput, real-time applications requiring maximum speedup.

## RCC Tree Performance and Literature

| Feature | Complexity / Effect | Literature Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Leaf Insertion** | $O(s \log N)$ per frame | Maintains real-time throughput for streaming [Feldman et al., 2013] |
| **Node Merging** | $O(s)$ weighted merge | Guarantees $(1\pm\epsilon)$-approximation |
| **Memory Usage** | $O(s \cdot \text{max levels})$ | Bounded by tree height, independent of total frames |
| **Streaming Efficiency** | Fast incremental updates | Supports real-time live video segmentation |

> Literature reports RCC trees provide **5–10$\times$ speedup** for streaming K-Means over naive full-image recomputation while maintaining segmentation quality.

## Real-time Performance Thresholds

| FPS Range | Classification | Suitable Backends |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 30+ | Excellent | **CUDA**, **Multi-threaded**, **MPI Hybrid** (low K) |
| 20–30 | Good | **Multi-threaded**, **MPI Hybrid** |
| 10–20 | Fair | All backends (mid K) |
| <10 | Poor | Sequential (high K) |

**Recommendations:**

* **Real-time target $\ge 25$ FPS:** Prefer **CUDA** or the high-end performance of **Multi-threaded/MPI**.
* **Scalability for large data:** **MPI** is the preferred choice for massive distributed datasets.

## Summary of Algorithmic Complexity

| Component | Complexity | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| K-Means (sequential) | $O(n k t)$ | Baseline |
| K-Means (coreset) | $O(s k t)$ | Coreset size $s \ll n$ |
| RCC tree insertion | $O(s \log N)$ | Streaming update |
| RCC tree merging | $O(s)$ | Weighted, preserves approximation |
| GPU assignment | $O(n / \text{cores})$ | One thread per pixel |

**Literature Insight:** Combining **coresets with RCC trees** allows near-linear scaling for streaming K-Means and guarantees that clustering remains within a **small $\epsilon$-bound** of the full dataset [Feldman et al., 2013; Bachem et al., 2017].
