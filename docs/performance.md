# Performance Analysis

## Overview

This document presents **performance benchmarks** for the real-time K-Means image segmentation system across different backends. Performance is measured in **frames per second (FPS)** during live webcam processing at 640×480 resolution with varying cluster counts (K). We also discuss **algorithmic complexity**, **RCC tree efficiency**, and insights from relevant literature.

## Benchmark Configuration

**Test Environment:**

* **Resolution:** 640×480 pixels (307,200 total pixels)
* **Coreset Size:** 2,000 points
* **Color Scale:** 1.0
* **Spatial Scale:** 0.5
* **Input Source:** Live webcam feed
* **Measurement Window:** 3-second rolling average for min/max FPS

**Algorithmic Complexity:**

* **Sequential K-Means:** $O(n k t)$, where $n$ = number of pixels, $k$ = clusters, $t$ = iterations
* **Coreset K-Means:** Reduced complexity to $O(s k t)$, with $s \ll n$ points in coreset
* **RCC Tree Update:** Each insertion and merge is $O(s \log N)$ for $N$ accumulated frames

**Literature Insight:**

* RCC trees have been shown to maintain $(1 \pm \epsilon)$-approximation of full K-Means with **bounded memory** and **incremental update time** [Feldman et al., 2013].
* Weighted coreset merges preserve clustering quality while supporting **streaming scenarios** efficiently.

## FPS Performance by Backend and K-value

| Backend        | K=2 (Min FPS) | K=2 (Max FPS) | K=12 (Min FPS) | K=12 (Max FPS) | Perf. Ratio     |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Sequential     | 15            | 17            | 5              | 6              | 1.0× (baseline) |
| MPI            | 13            | 31            | 10             | 13             | 1.8× avg        |
| Multi-threaded | 14            | 44            | 10             | 22             | 2.4× avg        |
| CUDA           | 14            | 55            | 15             | 44             | 3.2× avg        |

**Observations:**

* **CUDA** shows highest peak FPS and maintains performance with higher K values.
* **Sequential** drops significantly with increasing K, confirming theoretical $O(n k t)$ scaling.
* **Multi-threaded** and **MPI** demonstrate moderate scaling improvements.

## K-value Performance Degradation

| Backend        | K=2 → K=12        | Scaling Factor |
| -------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| Sequential     | 15-17 → 5-6 FPS   | ~70% reduction |
| MPI            | 13-31 → 10-13 FPS | ~40% reduction |
| Multi-threaded | 14-44 → 10-22 FPS | ~45% reduction |
| CUDA           | 14-55 → 15-44 FPS | ~20% reduction |

> **Key Insight:** Parallelization (threads, GPU, or distributed) mitigates performance loss from increasing K.

## Backend-Specific Analysis

### Sequential (CPU)

* **Complexity:** $O(n k t)$
* **Predictable but slow**, especially at high K
* **Best for:** Deterministic results, resource-limited systems

### Multi-threaded (CPU)

* **Complexity:** $O(\frac{n}{p} k t)$, where $p$ = threads
* **Good scaling** on multi-core systems
* **Memory-safe:** Threads operate on independent row slices

### MPI (Distributed)

* **Complexity:** $O(\frac{n}{p} k t + \text{comm})$
* **Performance depends** on network latency and communication overhead
* **Ideal for:** Large images or cluster environments

### CUDA (GPU)

* **Complexity:** $O(n k t / \text{GPU cores})$
* **Peak performance** for high-resolution streaming
* **Data transfer cost** may introduce FPS variability

## RCC Tree Performance and Literature

| Feature                  | Complexity / Effect            | Literature Insight                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Leaf Insertion**       | $O(s \log N)$ per frame        | Maintains real-time throughput for streaming [Feldman et al., 2013] |
| **Node Merging**         | $O(s)$ weighted merge          | Guarantees $(1\pm\epsilon)$-approximation                           |
| **Memory Usage**         | $O(s \cdot \text{max levels})$ | Bounded by tree height, independent of total frames                 |
| **Streaming Efficiency** | Fast incremental updates       | Supports real-time live video segmentation                          |

> Literature reports RCC trees provide **5–10× speedup** for streaming K-Means over naive full-image recomputation while maintaining segmentation quality.

## Real-time Performance Thresholds

| FPS Range | Classification | Suitable Backends            |
| --------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 30+       | Excellent      | CUDA, Multi-threaded (K ≤ 8) |
| 20–30     | Good           | Multi-threaded, MPI (K ≤ 6)  |
| 10–20     | Fair           | All backends (low K)         |
| <10       | Poor           | Sequential (high K)          |

**Recommendations:**

* **Real-time target ≥25 FPS:** Prefer CUDA or Multi-threaded
* **Offline/Accuracy priority:** Sequential is deterministic
* **Large distributed datasets:** MPI with optimized network topology

## Summary of Algorithmic Complexity

| Component            | Complexity            | Notes                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| K-Means (sequential) | $O(n k t)$            | Baseline                          |
| K-Means (coreset)    | $O(s k t)$            | Coreset size $s \ll n$            |
| RCC tree insertion   | $O(s \log N)$         | Streaming update                  |
| RCC tree merging     | $O(s)$                | Weighted, preserves approximation |
| GPU assignment       | $O(n / \text{cores})$ | One thread per pixel              |

**Literature Insight:** Combining **coresets with RCC trees** allows near-linear scaling for streaming K-Means and guarantees that clustering remains within a **small ε-bound** of the full dataset [Feldman et al., 2013; Bachem et al., 2017].
